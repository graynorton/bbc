Here's a new restoration item for any Early Bronco. This is the Ford emblem that goes in the inset area of the door jamb. This item goes only on the driver's side so order just one. This brand new emblem is a nice finishing touch to a fresh paint job and it's high quality so it will last. It comes sticky-backed, but I recommend using white double-sided foam tape which is very close to the foam tape Ford used to attach these originally. Call or e-mail to place your order!
