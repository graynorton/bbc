We have re-worked our Baja Bronco tire covers! These are authentic reproductions from an original. However this time we've adjusted the registration so the screening is very precise. Material is off-white naugahyde. They are available as a 36" circle. This way you can have them tailored to match your spare by a local upholstery shop. We can still provide fully sewn covers at an additional cost, but cannot guarentee they will fit your exact brand, size, style of spare tire. Call or e-mail to place your order!
