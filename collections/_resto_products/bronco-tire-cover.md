Finally, a tire cover for your regular Bronco; this will look great whether your Bronco is stock, rock, EB or Big Bronco. It is a very old logo that was first seen on the race Broncos that Stroppe and Associates and Holman Moody-Stroppe built. The logo also appeared in some early magazine ads and was available on a tire cover from Stroppe in the early 70s. These are all-weather long wearing silk screened and made of top grade vinyl. They are available as a 36" circle in either blue or orange. This way you can have them tailored to match your spare by a local upholstery shop. We can still provide fully sewn covers at an additional cost, but cannot guarantee they will fit your exact brand, size, style of spare tire. Available in orange and blue with black border.
