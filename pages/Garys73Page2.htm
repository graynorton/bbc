    support had been pushed forward via some tubular braces in order to make room for the A/C condensor.  Kind of a crude 
    move, but I guess it got the job done.  Since A/C is in the works for this truck, we took note of how NOT to do it.  Not only 
    did this bow the core support, it looked pretty hokey, causing the grill to push out.</font></td>
