Heck this one would be easy to restore too.  Here are the details:  1973 Baja(4/73) that was 
a Los Angeles truck since new.  302 with c4 automatic trans and factory Ford power steering, 
4.11LS gears.  This truck was well preserved and still has lots of the Stroppe items in place: 
Rollbar, bumper braces, original bumper, trailer hitch, Stroppe dual shock mounts, and steering 
wheel(not currently on truck).  This truck also has Stroppe-installed sway bars front and 
rear.</font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">Even though this Baja was repainted a rather 
ugly shade of yellow, it was a decent job and still shines pretty well.  The current owner chose 
to spend some money taking care of the interior and putting it back to stock.  Notice the nice 
Sport door panels, recovered Sport seats in correct vinyl, and new dashpad.  The interior is basicly 
done at this point.  The truck is basicly a paint job away from being a very nice, correct Baja.</font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">Though not completely stock, it would 
take very little to make it so.  Or leave it as is and drive and enjoy it now, knowing it would 
be easy to restore later.  It has a nice new CD player stereo, aftermarket steering wheel, and 
softtop.  The front brakes have also been converted to disc with a power booster.  Wheels are slots, and 
while not the original US INdys with 1" positive offset, they are in great shape and 15x8 - as 
close as you can find to original Baja Bronco wheels.</font></td>

gas tank on the passenger side that may have been Stroppe installed.  This truck also had some old 
Baja 1000 chase notes in the glovebox and tucked in behind the dash.  That and the extra tank suggest this truck has played a bit 
south of the border!
