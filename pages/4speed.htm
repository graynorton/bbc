  Not sure if you all were watching, but we had latched onto this 1972 Baja back in January
 of last year.  Unfortuneately we were in the middle of a move and had to let it go; you 
may have seen the auction on eBay.  Well, anyway, the new owner decided a Shelby was more 
to his liking, so we bought it back.  This picture is from a happier day though...</font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">It seems that this particular Baja 
suffered a much worse fate than most of those pictured elsewhere on this site.  The victim 
of a drunk driving accident, this Baja was almost totalled and parted out!  It all started 
with a call from a fellow Baja owner in November of 2004.  He said his beloved Baja, Iggy, was 
killed out in front of his house by an E350 Ford with an intoxicated driver at the wheel.  The 
Baja ended up at a Bronco shop for restoration, but somehow, it was parted out.  They sold off 
the windshield, rollbar, doors, engine, and hardtop before I was able to stop them and save the 
truck.</font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">I was skeptical at first as I had previously
 thought the truck had manual steering and 3-speed on the floor, making it a lower-optioned Baja.  
Not that they are not worth saving....any Baja needs to be preserved.  It's just that I wasn't sure, 
I wanted to be the one.  Well after a few phone conversations with the Bronco shop involved, I 
found this Baja was actually a rare 4-speed equipped Baja, one of 2 known to exist.  And therefore.....
must be saved.  So I sent a check and had the truck transported up to northern California.  As 
soon as I got it I spied the black transmission tunnel extension identical to the one pictured in 
the Stroppe catalog.  Historically, white fiberglass or textured plastic has been what came with 
Duff, Hurst, and other 4-speed shifters.  The one on the truck is toast, but of course will be 
retained for historical value.</font></td>

first time and the damage was exposed.  The frame isn't bent, but the rear spring on the left side 
is.  The left rear quarter will be replaced complete with the wheel tub, while retaining the 
latchpost.  Another Stroppe rollbar was acquired to replace the original that was straightened 
and sold to the east coast by the Bronco shop.</font></td>

real special about the doors off a stroppe...except for that paint job...maybe Steve Sampson, 
current owner of the doors, and EBR president will let us peel off the paint at the 40th anniversary...
C'mon, how bout it Steve?!

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">During it's stay in Colorado after we sold it,
it found a set of doors and a shabby cage.  Both are for sale.  You want em???  The truck is 
a pretty unique Baja.  It is also equipped with the Stroppe-installed power steering as well as all 
the normal Baja items: bumper braces, dual shocks, 4.11 gears, trailer hitch, wheels, etc, which 
are all still in place.  Another cool option on this Baja are Rear Air Bags for the springs.  The Marti 
Report on this truck shows it was originally sold at Robinson Ford in Calexico, CA, right on the border....
a true Baja Bronco.
Reconstruction of the tub was scheduled for 2006, but the scope of the restoration has become
much larger and will require we finish the chassis first.  That is what I'm doing right now so
