sold our previous project Bajas in recent years, and only having a our nice condition 71, we 
bought another Baja.  This one is to drive and not worry about so much.  I can actually park it 
at the supermarket and drive it in the rain or up to the snow country!</font> </td>

some time.  I think it was in 98 when I was at Wild Horses working the phones.  I had 2 other Bajas
 at the time and couldn't really free up enough money to motivate the owner at the time.  So 
the truck became lost for a few years until I got a call in the summer from the owner and we 
were able to strike a deal.</font> </td>

homemade trac bar drop bracket, cut front fenders, sporty mirrors!, original paint throughout, non-original slot 
mags, bald 35" tires, rebuilt 4.11 front and rear, rebuilt t-case, customized trailer hitch, Holley 2V 
carburetor on top of an early 80s Ford 302.  I got the original motor with the truck...died of a broken timing 
chain.</font> </td>

the south SF bay area, and after receiving the Marti report, we found...it is!  It was originally 
sold through West Valley Motor Sales, which is now Frontier Ford.  We just drove by today and took 
a picture in front of it's old home.  Must have sat on the lot tho, as it was built in 11/72 and sold 
in late September '73.</font> </td>

cool sticker in the left hardtop window.  Mexico Instant insurance.  Thats what you get before 
you cross the border into Baja or Mexico so you wont go to jail.  Kind of neat to see that this 
Baja actually spent some time south of the border....hey, thats true of both our Bajas!</font> </td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">This truck reportedly had a Warn winch bumper 
and winch when it was purchased from the second owner in the mid 80s.  The buyer(3rd owner), 
couldnt' afford the winch so he left it there and took the Bronco sans front bumper.  Man I wish 
we had that winch!  The third owner also removed the third gas tank and the Jerry can that was 
bolted directly to the left quarter panel.  They hacked the chrome in half to install it!  Yeah, 
this Baja is not a cream puff, or show truck, but a real true survivor with scars from years of 
correct use!</font> </td>

to near new condition or plans for a big undertaking.  I have a feeling the original engine will 
end up back in it.  I feel the scars and signs of use really make the truck what it is and if you 
restore that stuff away....well...it's gone!  They're only original once.  Also, if you know this truck 
or Bob Shaman, the original or 2nd owner, please let me know as I'm trying to track down it's history.  <a href="mailto:andrew@bajabronco.com"><font
