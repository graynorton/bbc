	How many Early Bronco owners have dreamed of working for someone like the
	legendary Bill Stroppe?  
	For one Arizona Classic Bronco member, Brad Searer, that dream became a
	reality nearly twenty five 
	years ago when he left Tucson, Arizona and headed west to seek his
	fortune in the automotive mecca that 
	was, and is, southern California.  The years Brad spent in Long Beach are
	still firmly etched in his mind 
	today and form the basis of his love for the early Ford Bronco.

	While working in the parts department at a local Ford dealership, Brad
	decided to leave Tucson in in the 
	mid 1970's and headed west to the Los Angeles area.  He says he simply
	walked into Stroppe's shop and 
	asked for a job.  He started with the most menial tasks around the shop
	but soon Stroppe discovered the 
	young lad knew his stuff and before he knew it, he was Stroppe's parts
	man at the shop.   In addition to 
	procuring parts for the various off road racing vehicles in the shop,
	Brad was also responsible for keeping 
	the other project needs fulfilled as well.  In addition to the off road
	racing vehicles, Stroppe was also 
	responsible for maintaining Ford's West Coast Test Fleet.  And so, for
	the next eight years, in various 
	capacities, Brad enjoyed a close working relationship with Bill Stroppe
	and a close personal friendship as 
	well.

	So the usual first question that comes up when you meet Brad is, "what
	about all the cool Broncos around 
	the shop?".  The truth is, he missed the glory years of Bronco racing.  
	Big Oly had been retired a year or 
	two before when Stroppe and Parnelli Jones crashed and killed a spectator
	in Mexico in the 1974 Baja 
	race.  The Baja Broncos had all been built by the time he started.  Brad
	did get to race in an early Bronco, 
	though, in the 1976 Baja 1000.  As a Stroppe employee, Brad went to most
	of the races as a pit crew member 
	and helped chase the race vehicles during the race and help with any
	mechanical repairs that were 
	needed.  In the 1976 1000, Brad was at the Stroppe pit about 150 miles
	into the race.  One of the Broncos 
	racing that year was driven by a Mexican named Alfonso Barbosa.  When
	Barbosa came into the pits at the 
	150 mile mark, Jaime Martinez (Stroppe's crew chief), handed Brad a
	driving suit and helmet and told him to 
	get in the truck.  "What, me?"  replied Brad, in disbelief.  "Yes, you're
	the new co-driver", replied 
	Martinez.   Apparently the original co-driver wanted no part of off-road
	racing after 150 miles of pounding 
	and Brad was to take his place.  "After I learned to relax and not tense
	up for every bump," Brad said, "it 
	wasn't so bad".  He ended up riding for most of the race.  In following
	years he co-drive in numerous F-
	Series trucks prepped by Stroppe.    These races are still recalled
	fondly by Brad and after twenty years 
	he can still remember faces, conversations, and speeds on the dry lake
	beds (130 mph +) like they 
	happened yesterday.  He says, "I have to pinch myself sometimes to remind
	myself that here I was, a little 
	ol' boy from Tucson, riding with and hanging out with the big stars of
	off road racing".

	I asked Brad what the secrets were behind Stroppe's success in the desert
	for so many years.   He told that 
	Stroppe was a stickler for preparation and every nut and bolt was checked
	before every race.  Each truck 
	was torn down and inspected between races.  "Stroppe's trucks were always
	heavy and perhaps slower 
	than a lot of the other vehicles out there, but they didn't break down", 
	replied Brad.  His Broncos didn't 
	have anything special or 'trick' done to them in terms of modifications. 
	"McCarthy's (Mike McCarthy, ACB 
	member) truck has a far more advanced suspension system on it than Bill's
	trucks ever did," Searer stated.  
	Stroppe was a workaholic who worked seven days a week and demanded a lot
	from his employees but he 
	inspired you to do your best and work hard too according to Brad.  He
	recalled how Stroppe helped out 
	numerous people, particularly needy friends south of the border that he
	had come in contact with over the 
	years.

<font class="atbodytext" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext"> 
	Now almost two decades after returning to slower pace in southern
	Arizona, Brad still recalls his days spent 
	at Bill Stroppe & Son with fondness.  And perhaps most telling of
	Stroppe's influence, he still drives an 
	early Bronco and works in sales at a local Ford dealership.  His '66 is a
	familiar sight at Arizona Classic 
	Bronco runs and it's in a constant state of improvement and constantly
	evolving;  a tribute to his favorite 
	former employer.
