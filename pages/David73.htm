    bought his Bronco in Colorado a few years ago. It is all original except for a rebuilt 302
    with an Edelbrock manifold and Holley 600 carb. The C4 has also been gone over and
    features a shift kit to make good use of the Detroit locker in the 4.11 rear. </font></td>

    Baja decals. If you have any information about the Gravel Grabbers 4Wheel Drive Center,
    please let us know. Looks like it was a Bronco dealer of some sort... <br>

    UPDATE: Bronco John from Elk Grove Village, IL helped us out with this one by sending us
    his original Fairway Ford Gravel Grabber catalog from 1974. Apparently Fairway Ford in
    southern California carried many aftermarket parts for the Bronco and Ford Pick-ups and
    called the parts department &quot;The Gravel Grabbers&quot;. The catalog was full of
    Stroppe, Hickey, and other quality parts. Our best guess is that either David's Bronco was
    originally sold at Fairway, or was modified by them at some point. </font></td>
