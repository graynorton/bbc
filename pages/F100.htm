    size="1" color="#000099">Here's a project we did a long while back.  We hadn't seen one of these conversions, so I thought I'd try it.  
This project was completed in 2003 and is currently being enjoyed by it's owner in the Monterey CA area.  Every once in a great while, we take on a non-Bronco project, or a project that is on a car that doesn't belong
 to or live with the greater staff of BajaBronco.com.  Well, this time we did both.  The owner of this
1966 Ford F100 shortbed wants it to be a fun hauler for a later model Mustang they race.  Here's the basic 
idea: Ford Lightning Pickup circa 1966.  Well, not quite that crazy but you get the picture: 5.8 EFI,
 4 wheel disc brakes, power steering, AOD trans, power brakes.  See below for details on some of the stumbling blocks as well as neat fixes, etc.  If you are building
 a similar rig and have any questions =   Email

    size="1" color="#000099">When Greg, the owner, picked this truck up it was pretty clean.  Basicly 
a 1966 F100 Custom Cab shortbed truck with the extra gauges in the instrument panel and the toolbox built
 into the lower bed.  Someone put a cheaper white paintjob on it and did the interior in grey late-model 
fuzz.  The motor, trans and the rest of the truck was basicly stock.  It originally had a 352 V8 engine 
and 3 speed automatic trans.  Original color was beige.  The only rust I've found is in the floors where
someone patched it up with a roadsign.  The same innovative genius used speaker wire and a pushbutton switch
 for the starter, glue everywhere in the interior and probably cried when his Dixie Chicks CD got stuck 
in the CD player.<p class="atbodytext"></font></p>

    size="1" color="#000099">I began by removing the 390 or 352 that was in it.  I also removed all the factory wiring and 
    anything bolted to the inner fenders and firewall.  The first order of business was to get the motor in and mounted.  Here 
    you can see I cleaned and painted the frame so I could see what I was doing.</font><p><font

    one locally with 30k miles on it and took it home to prep.  I removed all fuel injection parts and discarded them as we were going 
    to use Mustang parts for that.  Most of the bracketry for the serpentine system was retained.  <p class="atbodytext"></font></p>

    size="1" color="#000099">A new water pump, timing chain, and gaskets were used on the motor.  We retained the oil pan and simply cleaned 
    and painted the motor.  New valve springs and E303 Ford Racing cam were used.  Later after completion of the truck, I installed 
    a Comp Cams unit for better towing torque.  Always a learning curve.</font><p><font

    Mustang heads or Trickflow's Twisted Wedge heads.  So you can see here that the lip on the factory truck heads didn't allow 
    for us to drop it in.  We barely clearanced the intake to make it fit.  So far, 25k miles and no intake gasket blowout to report.  I have NOT 
    encountered this problem with any builds since... so unless you are doing this exact motor and intake, I wouldn't stress this part.  <p class="atbodytext"></font></p>

    size="1" color="#000099">With the motor ready to drop in, I concentrated on the disc brake system.  At the time I think we orderd all brakes from Master Power brakes.  We 
    got stock F100 front spindles rebuilt and ready to Kingpin -in.  That was fairly easy.   Though, my advice is stay away fromt he nylon kingpin 
    kits.  They wearout fast.  If you haven't done kingpins and have the money - take them to a shop that specializes in them, like Freeman Frame in San Jose, CA.  This 
    rear brake kit came from Master Power but was manufactured by someone else.  It uses Cadillac calipers and they are tricky to get working right.  Make sure your caliper is clocked 
    so that the bleeder is straight up.  You'll never get pressure if not.  Also be sure and adjust your ebrake levers and cables or you'll also run into problems.  By now, I'm sure 
    theres a better kit out there for rear disc on a truck 9".</font><p><font

    enough away so they didn't interefere.  I used a holes saw twice and cut between them to make the oval hole for the Ford plug.  Wiring harness 
    was a Ron Morris harness custom make for the truck using MUSTANG fuel injection set up from TPS to O2s.  <p class="atbodytext"></font></p>

    making a plate to convert the old heater inlet from square to round.  This helped me get enough room to route the harness.  I think I got 
    that piece from Wild Horses or Tom's Bronco Parts.<p class="atbodytext"></font></p>

    turn switch with a custom length.  I just measured for how much space was there and where we wanted the steering wheel.  Make sure you know 
    what steering wheel you are going to use...it helps to know ahead of time.  Steering box is stock 74 F100 power box.  It bolts 
    right to the frame, but you may need to clearance on the top channel of the framerail just a bit.  Be sure and get the pitman arm from the donor truck too. Order 
    new tie rods as well because you'll find out the 65-66 stuff is a little shorter and sometimes the ball joint studs dont reach far enough into the new disc spindles.</font><p><font

    I used an AOD rebuilt with better clutches, etc.  The cross member ended up in the right place and the stock trans mount holes 
    also lined up.  The angle was just a little low, so I spaced it up with a couple of nuts and some longer bolts.  It's not billet or chrome, but it's 
    gotten the owner home (for the past 7 years).</font><p><font

    size="1" color="#000099">That's a stock mustang 87-93 throttle cable going thru the stock location.  On the interior end, you'll need 
    to bend your pedal 90 degrees where it attaches, normally with a link rod.  grind off that little ball that normally attaches to the link rod, 
    so that you have just a hole in the end of the pedal.  This hole is the same size as the Mustang cable bushing on the interior end of the cable. 
    Simply slice into the hole and slide the cable thru, securing the bushing.  Connect the other end to the throttle body.  You may need to bend your pedal further to give adequate 
    WOT.<p class="atbodytext"></font></p>
