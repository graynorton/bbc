    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">Back in April, a client contacted us looking for 
a good Baja Bronco to take racing.  At first we weren't sure what kind of racing a Bronco would be doing 
in 2005, but we were intrigued.  As it turns out, our client is a successful racer in european vintage rally racing.  
His current racecar, a Datsun 240Z, was having trouble warding off the Porsches in it's class.  The 
4x4 class was full of Land Rovers and other lazy, heavy, trucks.....the Bronco should have a field day!!!</font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">First task at hand was to find a Baja Bronco.  Ours would have been 
perfect for this race...but it wasn't for sale.  After a search on the west coast and a visit to the Fabulous Fords Forever 
show in Anaheim, CA, we came back empty handed.  A week of calling around and chasing some known trucks turned up this 1975 Baja you see here.  
A deal was struck and our client had his truck!  We were happy to help find the truck and know it would enjoy some real excitement; much more 
than the "beach cruiser" duty the previous owners had used it for. </font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">Faced with it's first race deadline in October, this Bronco was 
not looking up to the challenge without some further work.  This class and type of racing requires all the modifications fit within actual modifications 
that were done at the time of the trucks actual use in racing.  This means that the Baja Bronco was the best canvass, as it had the 
rollbar, shock mounts, flares, etc as factory items, but we could also take advantage of some of Stroppe's race mods.  The problem is...
we needed to get working fast, so we held on to the truck and began work!</font></td>

 that the cars have to look pretty too.  They sometimes compete in shows in between racing...actually part of the 
requirements.  First step was to get it ready for a fresh paint job.  The truck is currently in the paint shop right now.  Stay tuned for:
 cage installation, gears, suspension, and final detailing! <br> Want us to build your next Bronco? <a href="mailto:Andrew@bajabronco.com"><font
