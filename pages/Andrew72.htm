    selling our 73 last week. This one is a '72 with Stroppe-installed power steering and
    automatic. The Baja has been owned by the same family since '73 and is very original
    throughout.&nbsp; This truck was very well taken care of and sometimes saw duty as a
    hunting rig.&nbsp; We are going to put a set of Stroppe wheels on it and see about getting
    it back to factory colors. Ultimately, we'd like to do a body-off restoration.</font></td>

    the paint job; so are we! The previous owner who bought it in '73 said it had the orange
    top and white hood when he got it. Upon closer inspection, the paint appears to be Ford
    factory original on the lower body. Only the top, hood, and tops of the fenders have been
    painted. Perhaps the original owner decided 4 colors was 2 too many. </font></td>
