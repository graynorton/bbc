What were those big muscle cars they were hot-rodding around in?  What's that?..Torinos?  Yeah, they were Customized Torinos....
okay, Vanna has some great party gifts and a copy of our homegame for your efforts.  Those Australian
 Falcons are from Australia and they are based on nothing we have over here.  We were recently visited
 by one of these rare cars and it's owner John Lantz.</font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099">This particular Falcon is an XB GT sedan in Mulberry Metallic.  It is an 
actual factory GT with special grill, stripes and a 351C 4V.  How come we never got GT 4-doors?  The owner, John, had
 brought this car over in November and it was in good shape except for the brakes.  It has a PBR brake 
system that is made in Australia.  Kind of rare on this side of the world.  When he took it to the local 
Mustang shop, they said it'd be $320.00 for a set of brake shoes, so we decided waiting for a set 
from Australia at $60.00 was a bit better deal. </font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099">Looks like the previous owner got his use out of the brake pads, no?  
I was quite surprised that the Caliper Pistons hadn't fallen out!  An interesting note about these calipers: 
They are held on with 2 bolts and safety wire.  Much of this car is the same way underneath.  The roads 
in Australia are a bit rougher than we have here in the U.S.A., so the designers made sure bolts would stay in, subframes wouldn't pull
 away from unibody, etc. </font></td>

See, cool vehicles have slot mags - and you thought I was joking.  If you're not careful, you'll learn something every day!  Best 
part about these wheels is that they are "Speedy" brand and say so on the center cap.  Too cool.  Oh yeah, 14x7. </font></td>

  No worries, John is on that one and if he can't slip it by somehow as a Torino mill or such, he's 
gonna drop it off for a smog-legal EFI swap like we did on our 5.0 powered Volvo.  All but aircleaner 
is stock here. </font></td>

dirty for nothing?  Oh yeah, it stops really well now and that guy behind the wheel is smiling. </font></td>
