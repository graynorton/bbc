<h1 align="center">Cars, Past and Present</h1>

<p class="atbodytext">Cars are a wonderful thing really. I've always like cars ever since I was
no bigger than a baby squirrel and I probably always will. I've had about 7 cars in my 9
years of legal driving but I still have a list of cars to buy for the future. The newest
car I've owned is a '73. My main lure to cars is the way they look and sound. Performance
is alright, but it is not as versitile and recognized as outward beauty and style. At
least not on as regular a basis. Actually, more than that I just like to build a car that
I first invision in my head.</p>

    got it when I was 14 as a surprise from my parents. I've spent all sorts of time with this
    car over the years and I don't think I'll ever sell it. A bunch of my friends would
    probably gang up on me if I did, as they have a ton of memories associated with it too. Oh
    yeah, this car is also my daily driver and it looks nothing like this now. It is currently
    '67 Dark Moss Green, with Parchment interior, green carpet, Stainless Steel Disc Brakes,
    C4 automatic, .040 over '66 289 V-8 with Edelbrock manifold and a Holley 750 carb. I'm
    also in the middle of changing out the 14&quot; styled steel wheels for a set of Radir
    Dual Rib wheels in 15x7&quot;. </font></td>

    I was a Junior in High School. It was purchased as a parts car in the form of a 66 Mustang
    coupe which had been attacked by a Toyota 4x4. As a result it's left taillight pointed
    toward the heavens and it had no trunk lid. It was still a great car though; it had a 3
    speed stick, dual exhaust with rotted out glasspack mufflers, and eightball stickers on
    both doors. 6 months later, after exchanging all the parts, I sold it to a friend who
    fixed it and today it's totally restored. </font></td>

    sell. For me this is it. It was a '57 VW bug that my father purchased as a daily driver
    when his VW van died. My mom hated the idea because it was really a toy. It had a 2-liter
    motor with dual weber carbs, a welded trans, custom interior and one of the best paint
    jobs I've ever seen. We used it like a car and one day we found bearing shavings in the
    oil. It went asleep in the garage and became mine. So I tore into the engine and replaced
    it with another 2-liter. I sold it shortly after this pic was taken in '95 to a 15 year
    old kid so I could go to college. </font></td>

    really into scooters. Instead of a car, he got an '84 Yamaha Riva 180Z, the best scooter
    you could get at the time. He rode it all through HS and on into college, where he found
    me an 87 Riva 200Z. It was a steal at 900 dollars....the only reason we lucked on to it
    was that no one could find the seller's house. He lived just out of town and his driveway
    was hard to catch. I kept the scooter til my first year of college when I decided I needed
    an old boxy Dodge Van. Sold the 200 for $950.00. </font></td>

    600.00 dollars. It was sorta rusty, had a homemade roofrack, tons of stickers, slow leak
    in a tire, and way too much character. I sold it after 8 months because I needed another
    one of my dreamcars. It was a good move to sell it because it would have been too
    expensive to fix it up like I wanted. Plus I had a beard and longish hair at the time and
    everyone thought I was a kidnapper or child molester. If I got lost on the streets at
    night I was screwed....I'd pull up to someone and they'd run the other way. Look at that
    face....he wouldn't hurt anyone!!! </font></td>

    one great car. If you ever get the chance to buy one, do it! This one was highly optioned
    with: AT, PS, AC, Tilt, Power Antenna, Kleenex Box, headrests, and Studiosonic sound. It
    of course had the power rear window, which is convenient if you are a gangsta because you
    can move your gun around with the larger window opening. It's nice. Sold it to a buddy in
    Minnesota who drove it home, kept if for a winter filled with doing donuts and sold it
    when the novelty wore off. </font></td>

    first Bronco. It was a nice evenly worn example. My friend Tim and I flew to Dallas, Texas
    to get it and drive it back in 1996. That was a great adventure. Since then I've had some
    good times at the dunes and off-road parks with it. I planned on doing a body-off
    restoration to it but a 72 Baja Bronco that I wanted more came up for sale and I sold it
    locally. Last I heard the owner was restoring it. </font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">I found this one for cheap in Seattle over
    Chrismas in 1996. My brother loaned me the money to buy it and I stored it for a year in
    Washington at the folks place. I wrote Ford to get the particulars on this one and they
    wrote back with none of the info I asked for... ...however they did find the production
    date which is March 5, 1971...my Brother's birthday. Kind of a cool coincidence. I have a
    feeling I'll hold on to this one for quite a while too. So far I've added Chevy disc
    brakes to the Dana 44 front axle, added a Stroppe pushbar, Mickey Thompson Classic rims in
    15x10 with 32&quot; BFG M/T tires. Well, I sold this one too in October of 2000 after I
    decided it was time to pay back my loan for the 1973 Baja Bronco I got in July of 2000.
    I'll really miss this 71 because it was just too cool. It is currently owned by Liz Eckert
    of Paso Robles, CA. Her boyfriend bought it for her for over twice what I had into it. </font></td>

    bought in March of 2000. It's an original Stroppe with the funky power steering, and
    S-T-R-O-P-P-E lettered tail housing on the trans. It was originally used for hunting and
    was a 2 owner vehicle when I bought it. The previous owner said the orange roof was on it
    when he bought it in late '73. I have seen it once since I bought it in March. It was less
    than 150 yards from the implosion of the KingDome. </font></td>

	It's a 73 that was the first one I ever saw...the one that started the website and my quest
	 for all the Bajas.  It was a San Jose truck from the start and was here til 95 when it was
	  brought to AZ.  I got an email one day from the owner whom I'd never spoken with.  He was 
	  ready to sell, so I went  down and got it.  Mechanicals were all sorta tired, but the truck

	commute vehicle.  I really didn't like anything a whole bunch.  It was hard to buy something
	I wasn't really interested in as I've always done with cars before.  So I went to the local 
	Ford dealers with the intention of getting a base model Ranger XL with a 4cyl.  They didn't 
	have any so I settled on an XLT with a CD player and AC.  It listed out for 17,800, but after 4 hours 
	of haggling, I got it for 13,700 plus fees.  Not bad for my first time.  Oh yeah, I added the 15x7 Progressive 
	Slot Mags to set mine apart from the other 2 Amazon Green Rangers on my Block! </font></td>

	at the Mustang Ranch.  This came in for a tune up and smog.  It also had a bad brake booster.
	  The owners thought it would cost 400.00 or so to fix.  When they found out it needed about
	   2 thousand dollars work, they sold it to me for 2500.00 or 3000.00.  I took the wheels, tires,
	    Stroppe pushbar, rear seat, Air Conditioning, and sold the car for 4k.  I sold the parts I took off
		 for 750.00 and kept the Stroppe pushbar.  I could have got it to pass smog, but it was rusted out...from Ohio. </font></td>

	picture, but it really isn't.  It's an 83 Volvo Turbo 242.  It only has 130k on it and the
	 interior is near perfect.  I got it for free from one of the Mustang Ranch's parts suppliers.  It belonged
	  to his dad and his wife ran it in to something and it sat since.  He wanted to sell it to me, but 
	  I just couldn't justify getting another car.  Pretty soon he got sick of it and told me just to come get it.  Can't
	   refuse a free car...I can't anyway.  So I got it and replaced the headlights, core support, turbo hose, etc, all from 
	   the local pick and pull junkyard.  Paid about 250 for the smog adjust and tune and sold the car to my roommate Dave, who 
	   is learning auto repair!  I told him I wanted it back when he was thru with it. </font></td>
