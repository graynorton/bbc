    Believe it or not this is the first Baja Bronco I ever saw.  I was 16 and cruising 
    neighborhoods for the very purpose of finding an old Bronco.  I rounded a corner and
    here was this Bronco with a neat orange, white, and blue paintjob.  I saw the original
    fender decal and was off to the library to do some research on my latest fixation:  A Stroppe
    Bronco!</font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">That's what started my love of the Baja 
    Broncos.  I often visited this Bronco but never stopped to talk to the owner.  The owner
    moved and I lost track of it for a couple years.  A friend who was going to school in San
    Luis Obispo reported seeing it on campus all the time.  Another couple years passed and I saw 
    it back in town but no one in the surrounding houses could tell me who the owner was.  Then
    finally in the summer of 2000, I got an email from a Baja owner looking to sell their truck that 
    they had owned for nearly 22 years.  It turned out to be this one I had been searching for.  I 
    flew to Arizona to buy it and now it is back in it's home town and lives at my house....4 miles
    from it's original dealer!  More info later. </font></td>
