    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">Just added to the market today, September 22,2009, is this 
    nice example of a 1975 Stroppe and Associates Baja Bronco!  This is a well cared for Baja that gets driven at 
    least every week and is offered completely turn-key.  Here are the details:  1975 Baja(11/74) that was 
a Fremont, CA truck when it was originally sold to the public.  What is neat about '75 Bajas is that they
 all seem to have been used as promotional or press vehicles by Ford and kept for a year before release.  We 
 have the original public release papers on this truck and it had 7000 miles on it when it was first sold and 
 titled.  It was about a year after it was built that it was actually bought by it's first owner.  The complete 
 history on this Baja is known and traceable by the paperwork that is included in the truck.  We have mileage 
 statements and repair documents that support it too. </font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">It spent most of
    its time in the Sierra Foothills and Sacramento area under the use of the daughter of the 2nd owner.  Being in 
    California all this time, it has very little rust.  The only rust we found was in the passenger floorboard where
    it is barely perforated; probably due to a water leak in the roof or an early owner hosing out the floor mats.  The truck was equipped with a rebuilt motor
    and 4bbl carb and upgraded ignition by the 3rd owner.  It only has around 14000 miles on the motor and transmission 
    at this time.  It has a cam, but still idles well and has excellent power.  Baja Broncos Unlimited recently added and tuned-in a
     new Holley 600 4bbl carburetor.</font></td>

     restored but rather cleaned up to be presentable and correct.  Overall the paint and prep work on the truck is 
     that of a driver, not a restoration, but as you can see - it looks fabulous and turns heads!  </font></td>

    on the truck now, this Baja also has the original window sticker from Ford.  The reason this is so great is 
    that it says at the bottom that the truck was shipped to Bill Stroppe and Associates first, showing it is a
     true Consignment Baja; one allocated specifically for Baja production at Stroppe's Long Beach facility.  </font></td>

    it was restored.  Here it is in original paint on the ranch near Sacramento.  Still looks good after 20 years!  Not many 
    Bajas have documentation this rich.
