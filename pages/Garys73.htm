    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">Gary contacted me last November about restoring his '73 Baja Bronco.  After flying up to Washington 
    state to meet him and see the truck, we made a plan.  With the 4-speed Baja restoration in the final stages, we could start 
    on his Baja pretty much right away.  Gary's had the Baja for a few years and acquired it from a good friend who had also been 
    an excellent custodian to this very original Baja.  This April '73 Baja, has been on the Registry for a long time and had 
    spent time in Idaho.  I rarely see them this original, so that was a blessing to start with such a nice truck.</font></td>

    '72 4-speed Baja.  The frame will be powdercoated, and I'll make some upgrades from there, keeping this Baja's original flavor 
    but adding the items that make a Bronco a pleasure to drive.  It wont be a completely stock Baja restoration, but to average on-looker, it may 
    appear that way!  More on that later.</font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">This is a neat Baja.  It was sold through Parker Motors Ford, in Parker, AZ, 
    which was Stroppe's go-to, for press vehicles, and other Fords.  It's a "Consignment Baja", or one slated from Ford for Baja production 
    and shipped with a run of other orange white and blue Broncos straight to Stroppe.  Usually, when sold through Parker, it meant
    the Baja was picked up at Stroppe's and Stroppe simply used Parker as the selling agent, as he was not a car dealer.  Usually, since the customer 
    is standing there at Stroppe ordering the truck, there was the option to add some one-off or non-standard Baja items.</font></td>

    to the quarter panel.  It's a Stroppe version of the "Ranch Hand" latch offered by Ford.  The Ford one sits closer to the 
    quarter and allows the tire rack to be swung to the side of the Bronco and secured.....on an UNCUT Bronco...dont try this 
    with flares using a Ford latch as your flare will crack.  The Stroppe crew remedied this situation with their version, held on 
    with the Stroppe standard aircraft bolts and a sleeved hole in the original tire rack, complete with load spreading standoff.</font></td>
