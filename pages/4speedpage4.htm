    4-speed Baja restoration.  Things have been hectic with our recent find of an original 
    Stroppe Racer, but we are still taking time out to work on the project.  What we've been 
    up to lately is a ton of painting!  We are using all original hardware on the chassis.  This 
    means lots of bead blasting, sand blasting, and painting/plating of parts</font></td>

    was pretty pitted from all the rust.  While I dont mind powdercoating over pits on an 
    original frame as showing scars of use, it's downright dangerous to use rusty hardware.  
    Luckily, my 73 project Bronco Ranger had original hardware throughout and was from Pleasanton,
    Ca orinally...so no rust.  I used the spring hardware from it, but was able to find these NOS
    U-bolts for the axle.</font></td>

    telephone pole, the 4-speed Baja had Hooker Fenderwell Headers.  Pretty awesome, but after 
    spending all the time getting the body straight, we chose to run these Hedman coated 
    headers for now.  If we need to, we'll make the change after resto to the Hooker units.</font></td>

    and painted.  They were actually in great shape and needed little work.  Here they are drying 
    with the rear spring hardware.  We still have to dive into the AirLift Airbag bracketry 
    and restore it.  It was never painted really well and the rust got after it to the point it is 
    pretty pitted.  Right now we want it to roll, so that can wait.</font></td>

    on another 72 Baja, but I need one for the 4-speed.  Mine is illegible.  Should be a D1T tag 
    pretty much just like this.  If you can spare it, that'd be great!  $

    starting to move on to the drivetrain.  The motor was gone when we got it, but other than the headers, 
    we really dont know how it was.  The last known driver reported it was dead reliable.  So we're hoping for that 
    with our correct date coded 71 302 we picked out of a Bronco locally.  It's got the Nostalgia 289 HP cam from 
    Comp Cams, roller rockers, fully balanced, high quality pistons...built for reliability.  While I search for the 
    right intake, I'm going to get started on trans detailing and painting the t-case.  Keep checkin back!  Pick a page, any page, <a href="4speedpage2.shtml"><font
