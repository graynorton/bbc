    chance to own a piece of SCORE racing history as well as one of the original Baja Broncos!  This 71 completed 
    the 1971 Baja 500 towing a travel trailer; the only time SCORE officials ever allowed this to take place.  On top of
    that great history, it's a very clean Baja Bronco.  For one, it's never been a rusty or run-down Baja - it's been 
    driven since day one and saw a long "running" restoration from '85-91.  The paint job is 20 years old and 
    still shines like new.  It sports all of it's original panels with the exception of the right front fender and the 
    tire carrier hoop.</font></td>
