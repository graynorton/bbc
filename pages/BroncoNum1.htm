    color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">A fair question, indeed.  The first production 
    Mustang has been located and restored, as has the first production Thunderbird.  Well
     then, whatever happened to the first production Bronco?  Did it rust away in some 
    farmer's field?  Did it get parted out after a rollover?  Is it safely tucked away 
    in someone's climate-controlled automotive museum?</font> </p>
    <h2><font class="ath2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"

    <font class="atbodytext" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"
    color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">The answer to all three questions is no.  
    Production Bronco number one, with its VIN number ending with  digits 732,000 is 
    resting comfortably in a covered structure in Texas.  It no longer has its original 
    engine or its original paint,  but it's still the first one.</font> <font class="atbodytext"
    face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000099"></p>
    <p class="atbodytext">The story of the first production is a bit sketchy, but here is 
    what we know.  The first Bronco was built on the prototype Bronco production line at 
    the Allen Park, Michigan plant in August, 1965.  It was originally Rangoon Red, had a 
    170 six cylinder engine, a 3 speed manual transmission, and it was a half cab.  The 
    current owner bought the truck in 1975 or 1976.  By that time, it had been repainted 
    and had a 1965 Mustang HP289 engine in it.  The rear fenders had been cut.  It had 
    also had the Bronco Sport package added to it, which sharp Bronco fans know didn't 
    appear on Broncos until 1967.  </font> <font class="atbodytext"
    face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000099"></p>
    <p class="atbodytext">So who added all these goodies?  That's where the story gets 
    interesting.  The current owner purchased the truck from the Christmas Mountain Land 
    and Cattle Company in Telingua, TX.  And who owned the Christmas Mountain Land and 
    Cattle Company?  Why none other than that little ol' chicken farmer himself, Carroll 
    Shelby.   We have been unable to determine the exact history of the truck prior to 
    the current owner's possession of it, but it can easily be hypothesized that Carroll 
    Shelby received the first production Bronco and promptly stuffed a HP289 in it.  
    Perhaps the truck was used as the prototype for the 289 V8's which appeared in the 
    Broncos beginning in March of 1966.  Perhaps the truck was used as a development 
    mule for the Sport package as well.  These are just guesses at this point and more 
    research is needed to validate or repudiate these hunches.  </font></p>

    <font class="atbodytext" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1"
    color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">The truck is currently resting comfortably on the
    owner's property along with his other two Broncos-a '66 roadster and a '96 wagon.  It 
    doesn't get driven much and the transfer case is currently being rebuilt.  Perhaps 
    someday the truck  will be restored and the rest of its story will be known.  But for 
    now, the first production Bronco will remain in anonymity, quietly waiting for the day 
    it will once again roam the hills and trails of the Lone Star State.</font> <font
