    a 72 Baja built by Ford with special paint and shipped to Stroppe in Long Beach along with another 19 or so Baja Broncos.  From there
    it sat on Stroppe's lot to be converted to a Baja.  That's where this unit's history differs a bit from other Bajas...</font></td>

    Bill Stroppe's.  Fairway and Stroppe had worked on many projects together and when Fairway needed a Baja, Stroppe would provide.  Being 
    that Fairway produced their own line of "Gravel Grabber" off road parts and sold and installed thier own equipment, that's exactly 
    how this Baja was converted.</font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">Instead of getting a standard Stroppe conversion, this Baja got Fairway's "Family Rollbar", Air conditioning, 
    dual front shocks, 15x8 steel wheels, Off road tires, Stroppe hitch, trimmed front fenders, and rear fender flares.  Later on in it's life,
    it appears to have been painted all orange, but the blue and white are poking through the now-thin paint.  This is a true Baja 
    Bronco with a unique path.  For more pictures, visit our parent file for this truck at
