    4x4 catalog and thought..."what a cool paint job."  I'd always been a fan of any mural or panel-
    painted custom van from the 70s and this appeared to fit that style...why not build a Bronco that way?  
    Well, as it turns out, this Bronco is in original condition and configuration, not a recent build....and it's for sale. </font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">This Bronco was converted by a company in Wisconsin 
    back in the day.  The paint, bumpers, and seat covering were modified as well as some other small details.  Right now,
    there isn't much known about this Bronco, but it appears unique and worth preserving and researching.  I would if I had 
    more time.  It's a C4 automatic trans truck with power steering and is in running, driving, shape.  It does have some 
    rust, but nothing terminal.  Asking in the mid 4000-dollar range.   Contact the owner, Bob at 816-539-0300 for more information.</font></td>
