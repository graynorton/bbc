If you've never been, I highly recommend it.  I've been going for 10 years now and this year was 
especially fun.  Check out all the pictures and see what transpired.<br><br>This first shot 
is the line in to the show.  It wraps almost all the way around a city block.  Crowds of people pile
 up to preview the cars as they enter.</font> </td>

to have your car chosen for this year.  Since the Bronco was turning 40 this year, they wanted nice examples 
of all the styles of Bronco on special display.  Along with my '71 Baja were a '66 roadster, a topless 67 Sport wagon, 71 halfcab, the former KbarS Balloon Chaser, 
the Pikes' Class 3 Baja Bronco and Parnelli Jones' legendary Big Oly among others.</font> </td>

Beard bench seat up front.</font> </td>

Pat Crawford and Dane Partridge.  This one was all stock, and original.  Not only original as in "unmodified", but 
original as in unrestored too!  It's an unrestored survivor Baja that Pat's father bought brand new.  It's been extremely 
well cared for and preserved.  It has a ton of "paint OK" stamps and mechanic notation stickers 
under the hood.  Probably the nicest survivor Baja we've seen.</font> </td>
