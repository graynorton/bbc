got a call from Brian in North Carolina.  He mentioned he had a rollbar I'd probably want for 
the 4-speed Baja.  He then told me the story of how he bought it from a Bronco shop in San Diego 
who had been parting out a Baja ....THIS Baja!  So we struck a deal and now the original rollbar 
for this very Baja is back in the same garage with the truck.  How cool.  Thanks Brian, your 
Tuffy LockBox is on it's way now that the holidays are over!</font></td>

 down til there was nothing left bolted on.  I had it sandblasted and brought it to work at 
my day job, B&B Collision Repair(www.bbsaab.com).  There my friend Vince fixed the frame horns, 
straightened the left front body mount, extracted a few rusted bolts, and cut off the old 
exhaust hangers.  From there it was off to the powdercoaters!</font></td>

it was into the oven for a double coat of 60 percent gloss black.  The frame had spent too many 
years on salty Baja beaches and on the San Diego coast for it to make sense painting the frame.  
This Baja will be driven regularly when done, so long-term durability was the goal and reason for the 
choice of powdercoat over paint.  And the sheen is still awfully close to stock for a Bronco frame.</font></td>

was totting around the drivetrain for rebuilds.  The transmission went over to my longtime friend 
Rod Creger at Mustang Ranch in Santa Clara (www.mustangranch.biz).  He tore into it, complained about 
how it stunk up the whole shop, put in all new bearings and synchros and then smiled and called it good.  Gears
 and case looked used, but not abused.  Note the factory Ford markings "11" and some other paint marks.  
I may try to duplicate them, but in any case photos have been taken for the scrapbook...and you're viewing pleasure.</font></td>

Straight Line Steering in San Jose.  There we got the bad news that the case was toast.  Too much 
rust in the sealing area.  Buildable, but it'll leak.  Hmmm.  Okay, well...what to do.  Good news was
that Straight Line has been around forever and had a spare case on the shelf. The friendly owner/manager 
informed me the box is a hybrid, and the guts are fairly uncommon but the case is around if you know 
where to look.  Perfect "I'll take one!"  Now the whole unit is back together and ready for some 
fresh Poppy Red paint.

file boxes full of parts assemblys and hardware that need painting, plating, or repacement.  My advice 
to anyone doing what I"m doing - spend the extra time to label and save all your hardware.  I think 
thats the key to getting something like this actually finished; it takes out lots of guess-work and 
keeps things rolling.  All these baggies will keep me busy during the rainy season..thats for sure!  Check
