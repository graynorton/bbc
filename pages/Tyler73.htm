	family since his grandfather ordered it in early '73.  It came highly optioned
	from Stroppe and the dealer with a Warn winch bumper and 8000 lb. winch complete
	with in-cab controls, Cibie lights, Clardy air conditioning, dual exhaust with
	glasspacks, and rear swaybar.  On top of all those original options, Tyler has
	updated the Baja with some modifications.
	</p></font>
	<font class="atbodytext" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">To start with he moved the Cibie lights around to the rear bumper and
	added some high power aftermarket lights to the original winch bumper.  Tyler
	had upgraded the stock suspension with a Wild Horses 2.5" when I took these
	photos at the Bronco 30th anniversary.  Other mods include a front cage kit
	for the rollbar and an Autometer Tachometer.  Rounding out the Baja is a
	Kayline Convertible top over the original paint job.
