    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">Here's a nice Baja Bronco that has just come up for sale.  It's a 73 model with 
    fresh paint.  Paint looks to be that of a good driver condition, it's 3 years old, but has been stored inside.  As you can see the chrome
    is still off the truck from being painted, but it's all included.  The owner reports that most of it is original and replacements would look best 
    with the paint however.  Original front fenders were retained, and most of the Baja 
    items are still on the truck, with the exception of the wheels.  </font></td>

    size="1" color="#000099"><p class="atbodytext">The truck still has it's original 302 and 2bbl carburetor and runs pretty well, but hasn't been run regularly in 
    the last couple years.  The 
    C4 has had an overhaul, and the truck now has a long travel James Duff suspension on it with 35s; a Baja that will go over anything comfortably.  Overall it's a
    nice truck that needs finishing touches: interior, chrome, tune-up and a driver!  Contact Jim, the owner for more information.  He and the Bronco are in Cedaredge, Colorado
