						We've retooled the Cactus smasher as of 11/2016 - it is now concours correct and only availble through Baja Broncos!  Cactus Smasher Pushbar!  This item was an option on Baja Broncos starting 
						in 1973.  It was a standard item on the 1974 and 1975 Bajas.  It was also a very poplular item sold over the 
						counter and mail-order through Stroppe & Associates.  This is the most handsome pushbar available for your Baja or early Bronco.  You have two drill two holes in your bumper, but the rest of the attaching points are pre-existing holes; installation is a snap!
						  These are shipped in bare steel so you can powder coat or paint as you see fit.  We do offer bolt kits, paint, and powdercoat at an additional 
						cost.  Call or e-mail to place your order!<br><br>
