			Here's Jack Niederkorn's Baja Bronco.  Jack has been into Broncos for a
			long time and decided it was time to get a Baja, so he purchased this one out
			of Northern California.  It's a '71 with both the automatic and the Saginaw
			power steering.  It also has the painted steel wheels instead of the optional
			U.S. Indy mags.

			Probably the most unique thing about this truck is the Stroppe
			installed roll cage.  It's a very nicely tucked unit that still allows for
			ease of entry and exit and use of the glovebox.  I believe Jack's plans call
			for a compete restoration.
